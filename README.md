## flake8

flake8 allows you to validate your Python code against the PEP 8 coding conventions and pyflakes.

The .flake8 file allows to configure flake8 and thus it will be enough to launch the `flake8` command to generate the report.
The report is generated in the *flake-report* folder under the name *index.html*. To open the report open the *index.html* file with a web browser.
