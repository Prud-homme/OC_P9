## Installation and execution using venv and pip

‚ö†Ô∏è Git and Python must be installed first.

1. Clone this repository using `$ git clone https://github.com/Prud-homme/OC_P9.git` (you can also download the code [as a zip file](https://github.com/Prud-homme/OC_P9/archive/refs/heads/main.zip))
2. Move to the OC_P9 root folder with `$ cd OC_P9`
3. Create a virtual environment for the project with `$ python3 -m venv env`.
4. Activate the virtual environment with `$ env\Scripts\activate` on windows or `$ source env/bin/activate` on macos or linux.
5. Install project dependencies with `$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
6. Create the project database with `$ python manage.py migrate`
7. Run the server with `$ python manage.py runserver`

When the server is running after step 7 of the procedure, the Web App can be launch from the URL: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000 "LitReview Web App").

Steps 1-3 and 5-6 are only required for initial installation. For subsequent launches of the Web App, you only have to execute steps 4 and 7 from the root folder of the project.

üóíÔ∏è *Notes:*

* *Depending on the installation of python it is possible that the `python3` command is not recognized under windows. In this case, you will have to replace `python3` by `python`.*
* *To disable the virtual environment, run: `$ deactivate`.*
